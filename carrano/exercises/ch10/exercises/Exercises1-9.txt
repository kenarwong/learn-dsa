Exercise 1)

a. After arriving at a party, you shake hands with each person there.

O(n)

b. Each person in a room shakes hands with everyone else in the room.

O(n^2)

c. You climb a flight of stairs.

O(n)

d. You slide down the banister.

O(n)

e. After entering an elevator, you press a button to choose a floor.

O(1)

f. You ride the elevator from the ground floor up to the nth floor.

O(n)

g. You read a book twice

O(n)

Exercise 2)

For every step backtrack back to the beginning and start over.

Exercise 3)

a. Computing the sum of the first n even integers by using a for loop

O(n)

b. Displaying all n integers in an array

O(n)

c. Displaying all n integers in a sorted linked chain

O(n)

d. Displaying all n names in an array of linked chains

O(n^2)

e. Displaying one array element

O(1)

f. Displaying the last integer in a linked chain

O(1)

g. Searching an array of n items for a particular value by using a sequential search

O(n)

h. Searching an array of n items for a particular value by using a binary search

O(logn)

i. Adding an item to a stack of n items

O(1)

j. Adding an item to a bag of n items

O(1)

Exercise 4)

O(n^2)

Outer loop loops n-1 times
Second to outer loop loops n-1 times
Inner loop loops 10 times (constant)

Exercise 5)

Outer loop: n-1
Inner loop: p

0 + 1 + ... n-1 = n*(n-1)/2

Exercise 6)

No, sequential search is O(n) and binary search is O(logn) for large arrays and for worst cases.

Exercise 7)

Drop lower order terms and constants.

Exercise 8)

loga(n) = logb(n)/logb(a), for all constants a, b > 1
logb(a)*loga(n) = logb(n), logb(a) is a constant

if f(n) is O(g(n)), then c*f(n) = O(g(n))
we can drop the multiplicative constant terms

therefore, loga(n) = logb(n)

Exercise 9)

if f(n) is O(g(n))
and d(n) is O(h(n))

then, f(n) + d(n)
is O(max(g(n),h(n)))

so 7n^2 + 5n is O(max(n^2,n)) = O(n^2)
